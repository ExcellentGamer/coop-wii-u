# SM64 Coop Wii U
To make the game, go to the "wii_u_setup.bat" and run it! (make sure your mingw64 is installed to "C:\msys64\mingw64.exe"). After using the setup script run the wii_u_builder.bat file and wait for it to finish, locate build/us_wii_u and put the rpx in your "wiiu/apps" folder on your sd card. If you use external data be sure to copy "sm64coop_res" to the root of your sd card!

## Goal
The goal of the project is to port the sm64ex-coop repo to the nintendo wii u with all of its features
