# sm64ex-coop
Online cooperative multiplayer mod for SM64, aiming to synchronize all entities and every level for two players.
Fork of [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex). 

Build instructions are available on the [sm64ex wiki](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki).

Feel free to report bugs and contribute, but remember, there must be **no upload of any copyrighted asset**. 
Run `./extract_assets.py --clean && make clean` or `make distclean` to remove ROM-originated content.

## Goal
Create a mod for the PC port where two people can play online together peer-to-peer.
Unlike previous online attempts, this one will synchronize enemies and events such that you will be interacting with the same world at the same time.
